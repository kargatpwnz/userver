# Roadmap and Changelog

We keep an eye on all the issues and feature requests at the
[github.com/userver-framework](https://github.com/userver-framework), at the
[English-speaking](https://t.me/userver_en) and
[Russian-speaking](https://t.me/userver_ru) Telegram support chats. All the
good ideas are discussed, big and important ones go to the Roadmap. We also
have our in-house feature requests, those could be also found in Roadmap.

Important or interesting features go to the changelog as they get implemented.
Note that there's also a @ref md_en_userver_security_changelog.

Changelog news also go to the
[userver framework news channel](https://t.me/userver_news).
